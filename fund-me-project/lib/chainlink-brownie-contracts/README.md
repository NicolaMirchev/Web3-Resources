# Overview
This repository is a slimmed down version of Chainlink's official repo. It clones *only* the Chainlink `contracts` folder and the repo automatically updates every time there is a new NPM release. 

- NPM's latest release can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts
- Chainlink's official repo: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink

## IMPORTANT
As of v1.2.0 and onward, all the releases of this package are going to match the [@chainlink/contracts NPM tags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts). 
So the versioning will look "backwards", but we are starting with v0.2.1
